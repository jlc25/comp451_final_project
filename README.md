## Project description

We trained two different models using the Baseline-LFCC-LCNN model provided by the ASVspoof2021 challenge and using data from the DECRO dataset.

## Links

- LFCC-LCNN model from the official ASVspoof2021 challenge repo: https://github.com/asvspoof-challenge/2021/tree/main/LA/Baseline-LFCC-LCNN
- We used the DECRO dataset, accessible here: https://github.com/petrichorwq/DECRO-dataset

## File description

- You can find our final trained models in the following folders:

  - `Baseline-LFCC-LCNN/project/baseline_LA/decro_en_final_results/en_trained_network.pt`
  - `Baseline-LFCC-LCNN/project/baseline_LA/decro_ch_final_results/ch_trained_network.pt`

- All the files related to the model can be found in the Baseline-LFCC-LCNN folder.
- All the evaluation results can be found in the `results` folder
